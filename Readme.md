# Indian Rental Price Predictor (Delhi, Mumbai, Pune)

A small machine learning project that predicts monthly rental prices for properties in three Indian cities using city-specific Random Forest regression models.

This repository includes the data, preprocessing notebook, trained models, and a Streamlit app to make predictions.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Prepare data and train models (required if model files are not present):

   - Open `ds_lab_proj_new.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code and run all cells.
   - This notebook performs cleaning, exploratory analysis, and trains three models. It saves the model files (`rf_model_delhi.pkl`, `rf_model_mumbai.pkl`, `rf_model_pune.pkl`) and a locations CSV used by the app.

3. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

The app will open in your browser and let you input property features to get a monthly rental price prediction for the selected city.

## Files in this repository

- `ds_lab_proj_new.ipynb` — Data cleaning, EDA, model training pipeline.
- `app.py` — Streamlit application that loads the trained models and serves predictions.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies required to run the notebook and app.
- `Indian_housing_Delhi_data.csv`, `Indian_housing_Mumbai_data.csv`, `Indian_housing_Pune_data.csv` — Raw input datasets.
- `df_city_locations_and_coords.csv` — City location coordinates used by the app (may be generated by the notebook).
- `.gitignore` — Project ignore rules for Git.

If you ran the notebook, the following files will be created:

- `rf_model_delhi.pkl`, `rf_model_mumbai.pkl`, `rf_model_pune.pkl` — Serialized Random Forest models (one per city).
